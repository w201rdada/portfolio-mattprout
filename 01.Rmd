## More Seniors Living On Their Own Brings Challenges

Approximately 10,000 American Baby Boomers are reaching retirement age.  In retirement, many of these seniors would like to not have the responsibility of a house, but want to live in a socially engaging environment, such as an independent living facility.  This can be a problem if those seniors start to have health issues, and no one is there to take notice.  The problem is to have a system for independent living facilities that would alert someone if a senior’s health condition takes a turn for the worse.

## Introducing the Senior Sentry Service

The Senior Sentry Service is a service that automatically tracks the vital signs and habits of senior adults in their living situation, and combined with a medical profile of the senior, uses machine learning to detect abnormal conditions or behaviors, and generates alerts that notify a call center to follow up.
Fitness tracker technology currently exists to monitor the wearer’s steps, heart rate, temperature, and sleep patterns.  Some variation of this technology could be worn by the senior, although this would require the senior to agree to wear the monitor 24 hours a day.  Note that the living facility would be responsible for owning and maintaining the monitoring infrastructure, but seniors would need to subscribe to the service.
The data from the fitness tracker would be uploaded to a server, which would also have medical information about the senior. Per the regulations governing HIPAA, seniors would need to agree to have the service disclose protected healthcare information (PHI) to healthcare providers, and the service would need to follow the key elements of HIPAA when processing PHI.  The server would then perform analytics that would generate alerts based on abnormal conditions related to the following parameters:

1. Vital signs (heart rate, temperature).  For example, basic abnormality detection can be performed on heart rate and temperature information.
2. Sleep pattern.  For example, sleeping too much may be a sign of illness or depression, and lack of sleep may be due to stress or a side effect of a medication.
3. Activity (steps).  For example, if the senior stops walking as much, it might be due to an issue with mobility or a decrease in energy.
4. The system could also support an urgent call button on the fitness tracker that could summon assistance if the senior accidently fell and they pressed the button.

The alert would be sent to a call center that would contact the senior to recommend a visit to the doctor, or schedule a house call.  The call center could also contact a family member if the senior agrees to it.  A web portal would be accessible by healthcare providers during a visit so they could view data about the patient in the context of the alert.

## A Step Forward

The Senior Sentry Service is a step toward monitoring the health of seniors who live in independent living facilities . The system is designed to proactively alert medical personnel of health conditions, so that an intervention can be done prior to it becoming a medical emergency.  Obstacles with this solution may include HIPAA regulations and the limited set of measurements that the system can perform. Despite the limitations, this solution should improve the lives of seniors, give their families peace of mind, and reduce healthcare costs through early detection.
