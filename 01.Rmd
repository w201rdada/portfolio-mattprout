# A System for Monitoring Independent Living Seniors {#Senior Monitoring}

#### Keywords


## Problem Statement

More and more Americans aged 65 and older are retiring. The current trend is driven by the Baby Boom generation reaching retirement age.  Many of these seniors would like to not have the responsibility of a house, but want to live in a socially engaging environment, such as an independent living facility.  Among this group of seniors are those who live alone or may not have family who live near them.  This can be a problem if those seniors start to have health issues, and no one is there to take notice.  The problem is to find a way for these individuals to live independently, but have a system (requiring minimal effort on the part of the senior) where someone could be alerted if their health condition takes a turn for the worse.

## Proposed Solution

A possible solution to this is to create a service that automatically tracks the vital signs and habits of senior adults in their living situation, and combined with a medical profile of the senior, uses machine learning to detect abnormal conditions or behaviors, and notifies a nurse or social worker.

Fitness tracker technology currently exists to monitor the wearer’s steps, heart rate, temperature, and sleep patterns.  Some variation of this technology could be worn by the senior, although this would require the senior to agree to wear the monitor 24 hours a day.   The movement of the senior in their apartment could be achieved by sensors or video surveillance in each room.

The data from these sensors would be uploaded to a server, which would also have medical information about the senior (that complies with HIPAA).  The server would then perform analytics that would generate alerts based on abnormal conditions related to the following parameters:
1. Vital signs (heart rate, temperature).  For example, abnormal heart rates may be related to the senior’s medical history or current medication, and abnormal temperature may indicate a fever.
2. Sleep pattern.  For example, sleeping too much may be a sign of illness or depression, and lack of sleep may be due to stress or a side effect of a medication.
3. Activity (steps).  For example, if the senior stops walking as much, it might be due to an issue with mobility or a decrease in energy.
4. Movement.  For example, increased movement to the bathroom may indicate problems urinating, and increased movement to the kitchen may indicate eating problems.  Movement information would need to be obtained from either sensors in the senior’s living space, or image recognition from video surveillance.

The alert would be sent to a call center that would contact the senior to recommend a visit to the doctor, or schedule a house call.  

## A Step Forward

The proposed solution is a step toward monitoring the health of seniors living independently. The system is designed to proactively alert medical personnel of health conditions, so that an intervention can be done prior to it becoming a medical emergency.  Obstacles with this solution may include HIPAA regulations with the use of user’s medical histories, and the limited set of measurements that the system can perform. Despite the limitations, this solution should improve the lives of seniors, give their families peace of mind, and reduce healthcare costs through early detection.
