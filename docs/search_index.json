Figure 2: Hello Benjamin Franklin! Abstract: Senior Sentry Service Many Americans who are retiring opt to live in independent living facilities. Serious issues can arise if they start to have health issues and no one is there to take notice. The solution is the Senior Sentry Service that monitors the senior using a fitness tracker. Information about the senior’s vital signs, sleep patterns, and movement can be monitored, and machine learning would be used to detect abnormal conditions based on the data and the user’s profile. The system generates an alert that is sent to a health service with information about the event. A nurse could then make a house call to the senior if necessary, and also contact the senior’s family. This solution will save seniors money by allowing them to live in independent living facilities rather than in more expensive assisted living facilities. The system will give family members piece of mind knowing that their parents are being monitored, and will reduce healthcare costs through the early detection of medical conditions. Abstract: Animal Shelter Outcome Improvement Over a million animals each year are euthanized because shelters cannot find enough people to adopt the animals they have. Animal shelters have the desire to see that their often limited resources are spent in a way that brings the most favorable outcomes to as many animals as possible. The solution is a service that predicts the outcome of animals based on characteristics of the animal. The service would employ a classification model that would provide recommendations on how the improve the animal of each animal, along with a probability of their outcome after the recommendation has been implemented. This information could then guide shelters on how to direct their resources to particular animals. A secondary feature of the service would be a web portal for people to search for pets to adopt. This could be extended in the future to enable matching of animals with people who want to adopt. As a result of the solution, the outcome of more animals will be improved by finding homes for them, and the number of animals that are euthanized will be reduced.

["Senior-Sentry-Service.html", "Senior Sentry Service More Seniors Living On Their Own Brings Challenges Introducing the Senior Sentry Service A Step Forward", " Senior Sentry Service Keywords senior citizen, independent living, fitness tracker, monitoring, machine learning, early detection More Seniors Living On Their Own Brings Challenges Approximately 10,000 American Baby Boomers are reaching retirement age. In retirement, many of these seniors would like to not have the responsibility of a house, but want to live in a socially engaging environment, such as an independent living facility. This can be a problem if those seniors start to have health issues, and no one is there to take notice. The problem is to have a way for independent living facilities to alert someone if a senior’s health condition takes a turn for the worse. Introducing the Senior Sentry Service The Senior Sentry Service is a service that automatically tracks the vital signs and habits of senior adults in their living situation, and combined with a medical profile of the senior, uses machine learning to detect abnormal conditions or behaviors, and generates alerts that notify a call center to follow up. Fitness tracker technology currently exists to monitor the wearer’s steps, heart rate, temperature, and sleep patterns. Some variation of this technology could be worn by the senior, although this would require the senior to agree to wear the monitor 24 hours a day. Note that the living facility would be responsible for owning and maintaining the monitoring infrastructure, but seniors would need to subscribe to the service. The data from the fitness tracker would be uploaded to a server, which would also have medical information about the senior. Per the regulations governing HIPAA, seniors would need to agree to have the service disclose protected healthcare information (PHI) to healthcare providers, and the service would need to follow the key elements of HIPAA when processing PHI. The server would then perform analytics that would generate alerts based on abnormal conditions related to the following parameters: Vital signs (heart rate, temperature). For example, basic abnormality detection could be performed on heart rate and temperature information. Sleep pattern. For example, sleeping too much may be a sign of illness or depression, and lack of sleep may be due to stress or a side effect of a medication. Activity (steps). For example, if the senior stops walking as much, it might be due to an issue with mobility or a decrease in energy. The system could also support an urgent call button on the fitness tracker that could summon assistance if the senior accidently fell and they pressed the button. The alert would be sent to a call center that would contact the senior to recommend a visit to the doctor, or schedule a house call. The call center could also contact a family member if the senior agrees to it. A web portal would be accessible by healthcare providers during a visit so they could view data about the patient in the context of the alert. A Step Forward The Senior Sentry Service is a step toward monitoring the health of seniors who live in independent living facilities. The system is designed to proactively alert medical personnel of health conditions, so that an intervention can be done prior to it becoming a medical emergency. Obstacles with this solution may include HIPAA regulations and the limited set of measurements that the system can perform. Despite the limitations, this solution should improve the lives of seniors, give their families peace of mind, and reduce healthcare costs through early detection. "],
["NineLives.html", "Animal Shelter Outcome Improvement Overview Solution Saved Lives", " Animal Shelter Outcome Improvement Keywords Animal Shelter Euthanasia Machine Learning Overview The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) estimates that 6.5 million animals arrive at shelters each year. The majority of the shelter animals are strays, rescues, and surrenders. Many of these animals are returned to their owners or are adopted, but others are not so fortunate. It is estimated that 1.5 million animals are euthanized each year, representing a considerable loss of life and expense to organizations sheltering these animals. Shelters, along with the many people who donate to them, have a desire to see that their money is spent in a way that brings about the most favorable outcomes to as many animals as possible. If shelters could predict the outcomes of animals better (being returned to their owner, adopted, euthanized, etc.) they could focus their energies to improve the likelihood that more animals are adopted. Solution The proposed solution is a predictive model for the long-term outcome of animals brought into shelters. This would be provided as a web based service to shelters. The website would be easy to use, and would require no IT staff on the part of the shelter to deploy. As animals are brought into a shelter, information about the animal would be entered into the service, such as their type (dog/cat), breed, sex, spay/neuter status, age, color, whether they are house trained, temperament (for dogs only), personality (social, aggressive, shy), behavior issues (biting, scratching, barking, chewing), and the reason why they were brought in (stray, rescue, surrender). If the animal was a surrender, a sub-classification would be made if it was due to a health issue, behavioral issue, or housing concern (i.e. pet restriction where the owners live). If the animal was a stray, the age of the animal would need to be estimated, and there are existing methods to do this. Note that some animals have a microchip that indicates the animals’ ID, which can be matched to a national database to retrieve information about the animal. In this case, the shelter’s first step would be to enter the animal’s ID into an optional field, and any information that could be obtained about the animal would be populated. This data would be used in a classification model to predict the likelihood that the animal would be adopted, returned, or euthanized. The system would also provide a recommendation on how the animal’s outcome could be improved, along with the revised probabilities for the animal’s outcome after the recommendation has occurred. The shelter could use this information to make its animals more favorable for adoption. For instance, sick animals would be treated by veterinarians, and animals with behavioral issues could be given training. The system should be able to predict that a 6-month old puppy has a higher chance of being adopted than a 9-month old, so it would not recommend neutering for the puppy. In the case of truly limited resources, the probability score could also be used to help shelters prioritize resources to help as many animals as possible. The service would be cloud based and could scale up to support many shelters. A predictive model would be created for each shelter, as the demand for animals varies between regions and across time. The service would provide a web-based portal so that people who would like to adopt an animal can search for one online. A future enhancement to this service would be the addition of another model that matches animals with people who are looking to adopt a pet. Saved Lives The large number of animals brought to shelters that end up languishing there or are euthanized is tragic. Data science can be used to alleviate this problem by helping shelters focus resources on animals to improve their outcomes. The resulting increase in adoption rates and reduction in euthanasia fulfills the desires of both the shelters and those who support them. "],
