Figure 2: Hello Benjamin Franklin! Abstract: A System for Monitoring Independent Living Seniors Many Americans who are retiring opt to live in independent living facilities. Some of these seniors live alone and do not have family who live near them. This can be a problem if they start to have health issues and no one is there to take notice. The solution is a service that monitors the senior using a fitness tracker. Information about the senior’s vital signs, sleep patterns, and movement can be monitored, and machine learning would be used to detect abnormal conditions based on the data and the user’s profile. The system would generate an alert that would be sent to a health service and to the senior’s family with information about the event. A nurse could then make a house call to the senior if necessary. This solution will save seniors money by allowing them to live in independent living facilities rather than in more expensive assisted living facilities. The system will give family members piece of mind knowing that their parents are being monitored, and will reduce healthcare costs through the early detection of medical conditions. Abstract: Animal Shelter Outcome Improvement Over a million animals each year are euthanized because shelters cannot find enough people to adopt the animals they have. Animal shelters have the desire to see that their often limited resources are spent in a way that brings the most favorable outcomes to as many animals as possible. The solution is a service that predicts the outcome of animals based on characteristics of the animal. The service would employ a classification model that would provide recommendations on how the improve the animal of each animal, along with a probability of their outcome after the recommendation has been implemented. This information could then guide shelters on how to direct their resources to particular animals. A secondary feature of the service would be a web portal for people to search for pets to adopt. This could be extended in the future to enable matching of animals with people who want to adopt. As a result of the solution, the outcome of more animals will be improved by finding homes for them, and the number of animals that are euthanized will be reduced.

["a-system-for-monitoring-independent-living-seniors-senior-monitoring.html", "A System for Monitoring Independent Living Seniors {#Senior Monitoring} Problem Statement Proposed Solution A Step Forward", " A System for Monitoring Independent Living Seniors {#Senior Monitoring} Keywords Senior citizen, independent living, monitoring, early detection Problem Statement More and more Americans aged 65 and older are retiring. The current trend is driven by the Baby Boom generation reaching retirement age. Many of these seniors would like to not have the responsibility of a house, but want to live in a socially engaging environment, such as an independent living facility. Among this group of seniors are those who live alone or may not have family who live near them. This can be a problem if those seniors start to have health issues, and no one is there to take notice. The problem is to find a way for these individuals to live independently, but have a system (requiring minimal effort on the part of the senior) where someone could be alerted if their health condition takes a turn for the worse. Proposed Solution A possible solution to this is to create a service that automatically tracks the vital signs and habits of senior adults in their living situation, and combined with a medical profile of the senior, uses machine learning to detect abnormal conditions or behaviors, and generates alerts that notify a call center to follow up. Fitness tracker technology currently exists to monitor the wearer’s steps, heart rate, temperature, and sleep patterns. Some variation of this technology could be worn by the senior, although this would require the senior to agree to wear the monitor 24 hours a day. The movement of the senior in their apartment could be achieved by sensors or video surveillance in each room. Note that the living facility would be responsible for owning and maintaining the monitoring infrastructure, but seniors would need to subscribe to the service. The data from these sensors would be uploaded to a server, which would also have medical information about the senior. Per the regulations governing HIPAA, seniors would need to agree to have the service disclose protected healthcare information (PHI) to healthcare providers, and the service would need to follow the key elements of HIPAA when processing PHI. The server would then perform analytics that would generate alerts based on abnormal conditions related to the following parameters: Vital signs (heart rate, temperature). For example, abnormal heart rates may be related to the senior’s medical history or current medication, and abnormal temperature may indicate a fever. Sleep pattern. For example, sleeping too much may be a sign of illness or depression, and lack of sleep may be due to stress or a side effect of a medication. Activity (steps). For example, if the senior stops walking as much, it might be due to an issue with mobility or a decrease in energy. Movement. For example, increased movement to the bathroom may indicate problems urinating, and increased movement to the kitchen may indicate eating problems. Movement information would need to be obtained from either sensors in the senior’s living space, or image recognition from video surveillance. The system could also support an urgent call button on the fitness tracker that could summon assistance if the senior accidently fell. The alert would be sent to a call center that would contact the senior to recommend a visit to the doctor, or schedule a house call. A web portal would be provided so that healthcare providers could view data about the patient in the context of the alert. A Step Forward The proposed solution is a step toward monitoring the health of seniors living independently. The system is designed to proactively alert medical personnel of health conditions, so that an intervention can be done prior to it becoming a medical emergency. Obstacles with this solution may include HIPAA regulations with the use of user’s medical histories, and the limited set of measurements that the system can perform. Despite the limitations, this solution should improve the lives of seniors, give their families peace of mind, and reduce healthcare costs through early detection. "],
["NineLives.html", "Animal Shelter Outcome Improvement Overview Solution Saved Lives", " Animal Shelter Outcome Improvement Keywords Animal Shelter Euthanasia Overview The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) estimates that 6.5 million animals arrive at shelters each year. The majority of the shelter animals are comprised of strays, rescues, and surrenders. Many of these animals are returned to their owners or are adopted, but others are not so fortunate. It is estimated that 1.5 million animals are euthanized each year, representing a considerable loss of life and expense while sheltering these animals. Shelters, along with the many people who donate to them, have a desire to see that their money is spent in a way that brings about the most favorable outcomes to as many animals as possible. If shelters could predict the outcomes of animals better (being returned to their owner, adopted, euthanized, etc.) they could focus their energies to improve the likelihood that more animals survive. Solution The proposed solution is a predictive model for the outcome of animals brought into shelters. This would be provided as a web based service to shelters. As animals are brought into a shelter, information about the animal would be entered into the service, such as their type (dog/cat), breed, sex, spay/neuter status, age, color, temperament, and the reason why they were brought in (stray, rescue, surrender). If the animal was a surrender, a sub-classification would be made if it was due to a health issue, behavioral issue, or housing concern (i.e. pet restriction where the owners live). If the animal was a stray, the age of the animal would need to be estimated, and there are existing methods to do this. Note that some animals have a microchip that indicates the animals’ ID, which can be matched to a national database to retrieve information about the animal. In this case, the shelter’s first step would be to enter the animal’s ID into an optional field, and any information that could be obtained about the animal would be populated. This data would be presented to a classification model that would indicate the likelihood that the animal would be adopted, returned, or euthanized. The system would also provide a recommendation on how the animal’s outcome could be improved, along with the revised probabilities for the animal’s outcome after the recommendation has occurred. The shelter could use this information to make its animals more favorable for adoption. For instance, sick animals would be treated by veterinarians, and animals with behavioral issues could be given training. The probability score would be used to budget resources in case there are judgements that need to be made on which animals to focus on, when resources are limited. The service would be cloud based, and could scale up and support many shelters. A predictive model would be created for each shelter, as the demand for animals may vary between regions. The service would provide a web-based portal so that people who would like to adopt an animal can search for one online. A future enhancement to this service would be the addition of another model that matches animals with people who are looking to adopt a pet. Saved Lives The large number of animals brought to shelters that end up languishing there or are euthanized is unfortunate. Data science can be used to help alleviate this tragedy by helping shelters focus resources on animals to improve their outcomes. The resulting increase in adoption rates and reduction in euthanasia fulfills the desires of both the shelters and those who support them. "],
