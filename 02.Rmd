Animal Shelter Euthanized

## Overview

The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) estimates that 6.5 million animals arrive at shelters each year.  The majority of the shelter animals are comprised of strays, rescues, and surrenders.  Many of these animals are returned to their owners or are adopted, but others are not so fortunate.  It is estimated that 1.5 million animals are euthanized each year, representing a considerable loss of life and expense while sheltering these animals.  If shelters could predict the outcomes of animals better (being returned to their owner, adopted, euthanized, etc.) they could focus their energies to improve the likelihood that more animals survive.

## Solution

The proposed solution is a predictive model for the outcome of animals brought into shelters.  This would be provided as a web based service to shelters.

As animals are brought into a shelter using the solution, information about the animal would be entered into the service, such as their type (dog/cat), breed, sex, spay/neuter status, age, color, temperament, and the reason why they were brought in (stray, rescue, surrender).  If the animal was a surrender, a sub-classification would be made if it was due to a health issue, behavioral issue, or housing concern (i.e. pet restriction where the owners live).  If the animal was a stray, the age of the animal would need to be estimated, and there are existing methods to do this.

This data would be presented to a classification model that would indicate how likely the animal would be adopted, returned, or euthanized.  Animals with a high probability of being euthanized could be given special attention to make them more favorable for adoption.  For instance, sick animals could be treated by veterinarians, and animals with behavioral issues could be given behavioral training.

When the animal is returned to the owner, adopted, or euthanized, the outcome of the animal would be updated in the service.
The service would be cloud based, and could scale up and support many shelters.   A predictive model would be created for each shelter, as the demand for animals may vary between regions.  A benefit of having a common service would be that shelters could search neighboring shelters for animals that people would like to adopt.

## Saved Lives

The large number of animals brought to shelters that end up being euthanized unfortunate.  Many of the reasons are actually due to the fault of the owners for failing to tag their animals or not being aware that some dogs need behavioral training.  Data science can be used to help alleviate this tragedy by helping shelters focus resources on animals with the highest probability of being euthanized, thus improving the outcomes of these animals.
